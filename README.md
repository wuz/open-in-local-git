# open-in-local-git

**Use "Open in Github Desktop" to check out the branch in your local repo.**

This is an electron app the overrides the Github desktop application protocol handler to checkout
a `git` branch on your local machine when you click the "Open in Github Desktop" link on a Github Pull Request.

> Caution: this might replace the normal Github Desktop functionality. If you use it for anything other than the "Open in Github Desktop" link you probably don't want to use this!
